        The computer science department has many useful facilities and laboratories that helped developed and improved many technologies and scientific innovations that shaped our lives today. There are four main facilities that are popular in the computer science department of the University of Manchester: e-Science Laboratory, Cognitive Robotics Laboratory, Interaction Analysis and Modelling Laboratory, Mesoscience and Nanotechnology Workshop.

        <br>
        E-science Laboratory is used for creating and improving technologies and tools for scientists to use in their scientific research. This laboratory has conducted research and knowledge sharing in many different fields such as biology, chemistry, astronomy, social science, and more. Cognitive Robotics Laboratory is for developing and improving cognitive and learning abilities using the latest artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithm. This lab benefits from multiple domains from computer science and machine learning to psychology and neuroscience. As for Interaction Analysis and Modelling Laboratory, experiments are done there for accessibility technologies and visual actions like eye movements for handling the issues of web accessibility. Mesoscience and nanotechnology workshop Is a workshop that allows scientists to create, visualize, and characterize structures and devices with individual elements ranging in size from a few microns to 10 nm.
