        <h1 class="h1">Overview</h1>
        <p class="bodytext">
            The foundation year in computer science is a one-year programme (part of a four-year integrated degree programme). On this course, you will be considered an undergraduate at the University of Manchester and will be taught by university academics. In order to maintain your place in the first year of your chosen degree, you must meet the required progression criteria. 
    <h1 class="h1">Description</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">
        The programme is specifically designed to improve your mathematical and scientific reasoning skills and to prepare you for the first year of your computer science degree. It incorporates a variety of learning and teaching methods such as lectures, small group tutorials, seminars, and project work. 
    
    <br>
    <br>
    
        The programme includes a wide range of courses including mathematics, physics, and, where relevant, chemistry. You will also take Academic Skills and ICT modules (Information and Communications Technology). By the end of the  academic year, you will also complete a group project related to your intended degree programme that will be monitored by an academic from your future Department.
    </p>
        <h1 class="h1">Assessments</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">
        Coursework completed throughout the academic year accounts for a smaller portion of the overall assessment. Meanwhile, formal examinations at the end of each semester serve as the primary means of evaluation (in January and June).
