        Studying at university is a huge leap from studying at a sixth form. Firstly, the teaching style at university is very different as it is no longer classroom based learning. Most of the content is taught through lectures, and there is a huge emphasis on independent learning.
        <br>
        <br>
        A lot more responsibility is placed on you while studying at university; it is up to you to make sure that you attend your lectures and tutorials, and do the work you need to be doing.  
        <br>
        <br>
        There is a lot more variation from day to day during university, in sixth form, every day would follow the same basic format of timetabling, however in university it is different every day. 
        <br>
        <br>
         One of the biggest differences is the size of the university campus – it’s huge. This is a big difference from sixth form, as all of your lessons would have been in the same building, but in university different lectures and tutorials could be on different sides of the city.
