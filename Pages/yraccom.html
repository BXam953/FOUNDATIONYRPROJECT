            <li><a href="https://www.hellostudent.co.uk/student-accommodation/manchester/">Hello Student</a></li>
            <ul class="bodytextl">
                <li>Hello Student is ideal if you are looking for fancy student accommodation only moments away from the University of Manchester.</li>

            <img src="../assets/ACCOM2.png" alt="" class="imgl">
            <li><a href="https://www.vitastudent.com/en/student-accommodation/manchester">Vita Student</a></li>
            <ul class="bodytextl">
                Are you looking for a luxury student accommodation not further than 5 minutes walk from the university? Your best option here is Vita Student!
            </ul>
            <img src="../assets/ACCOM3.png" alt="" class="imgl">
            <li><a href="https://www.iqstudentaccommodation.com/manchester?gclid=Cj0KCQjwma6TBhDIARIsAOKuANy8rTmU6p2IlXtCXc6TpEnCIdu1kyun4y8PKBHs89hxCceoPblXmaIaArCTEALw_wcB&year=2022-23&sorting=featuredBuilding">iQ Student Accomodation</a></li>
            <ul class="bodytextl">
                Want to live near either the south or the north campus of UoM? We would recommend you iQ student accommodation, as they have around 7 buildings around the University of Manchester alone! They also offers variety of room options, 1-3 bedroom apartments/ duplexes, studios, en-suits and much more.
            </ul>
            <img src="../assets/ACCOM4.jpeg" alt="" class="imgl">
            <li><a href="https://www.unitestudents.com/manchester">Unite Students</a></li>
            <ul class="bodytextl">
                There is a reason that rooms at Unite Students become sold out the second the booking opens, its perfect location on Oxford St., and the fascinating range of rooms and facilities, and let us not forget to mention the Free Living Essentials and 24/7 security and assistance that Unite Students provide to their residents. 
            </ul>
