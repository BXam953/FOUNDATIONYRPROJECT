            I can’t express enough how excited i was the day I received my acceptance letter to pursue studying my passion in Artificial Intelligence in the University of Manchester, that I have rejected other universities offers immediately after I got the green light from my sponsors, and it was just then that realised I am, in fact, admitted to the university of my dreams. 
            In the beginning, I faced so many obstacles regarding my mental health and academics, it felt like I was running behind on so many lectures and everything was too difficult for me to achieve.             
        <br>
        <br>
        However; after reaching out to other students in the foundation year, I realised that I’m not alone, and it became easier for me to overcome the difficulties I was facing alone for a long while. I might still be running behind on a few things now, but it’s always better to have your peers by your side. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Although the beginning was full of difficulties and obstacles that I was finally able to overcome, I am still attached to my dream and I still aspire to continue pursuing this dream

        The process of going from living at home to moving to university is a very liberating experience. A lot of freedom comes along with moving, and a certain level of independence and responsibility is required in order to make the transition successfully. At first, I struggled with the transition (along with many others just like me). My problem was that I only saw the negative aspects of my moving away from home, and the responsibility was a bit too much. However, after a few weeks, I finally got used to it, I started working to a routine, and eventually I saw all of the positive aspects of my situation.
    <br>
    <br>
    Moving to university was one of the best decisions that I have ever made, and I can’t wait to see what the rest of my degree has to offer.

    When I first got the acceptance from the university, I was so excited. I wanted to understand the experience who study abroad and feel the joy of learning and studying at one of the top universities in this world.
<br>
<br>
As soon as I got here in Manchester, the feeling of homesickness started to come. I felt depressed. I was in a very dark place to the point even my eyes weren’t able to see anything except blank darkness. Then after reaching out to my friends and adapting to the environment and to the study life, I can say clearly and proudly that this is the best experience of my life. I have learned so much from my university courses and my life adventure. The computer science department is the best department that you can ever find in terms of everything. To everyone who wants or will join this university all I can say is YOU CAN DO IT!

    Overall, the programme has helped me improve my writing and mathematical skills, practise giving presentations, and, in some ways, adjust to university life before becoming a first-year student. However, in terms of programming and computer knowledge, I do not believe it has adequately prepared me to be a computer science student. I believe this is because, as a student with little programming experience, I was not well introduced to the computer science related course units, making it difficult for me to understand the content and solve the tasks in them. To avoid that, take time from the very beginning of the semester to go through the content and understand it and do your own research, also, don’t hesitate to ask your tutors for help!
